#STUDENT FEEDBACK SYSTEM Student feedback system is the web based feedback collecting system from the students and provides the automatic generation of a feedback which is given by students. I have developed student feedback system to provide feedback in a quick manner.So we called it a studentâ€™s feedback system which delivers via the student staff interface as online system which acting as a service provider. By using this technology we can give feedback in online system as fast as compare to the existing paper feedback system. The existing system carries more time to do a piece of work for this reason the online system feedback is implemented. Students will fill feedback using a standard form. In this project, security is also maintained. The result of feedback is only visible to authentic user.
